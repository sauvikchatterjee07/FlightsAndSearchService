## Introduction

The Flight Service Project is designed to simplify the process of flight management for both users and administrators. It offers a user-friendly interface for searching and booking flights, managing bookings, and handling various flight-related tasks.

## Features

- **Flight Search**: Users can search for flights based on departure and arrival locations, dates, and other criteria.
- **Booking Management**: Users can book flights, select seats, and manage their bookings, including canceling or rescheduling flights.
- **User Authentication**: The system supports user registration and authentication to ensure secure access to personal information and bookings.
- **Admin Panel**: An admin panel is provided for administrators to manage flights, view bookings, and handle other administrative tasks.
- **Flight Notifications**: Users can receive notifications about flight updates, such as delays or gate changes.
- **Payment Integration**: Integration with popular payment gateways enables users to make secure online payments for their bookings.

## Technologies

The Flight Service Project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Backend**: The server-side logic is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- **Frontend**: The user interface is created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is used as the database for storing flight data, user information, and bookings.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Payment Integration**: Integration with popular payment gateways such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) enables secure online payments.
- **Notifications**: Real-time flight notifications can be implemented using tools like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).
- **Deployment**: The application can be deployed on cloud platforms like [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
